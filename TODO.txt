- create object for player details
    - on selection of character, update player information with that character
- on selection of character, output game board to page
- I don't even know really
- gameboard is an array inside of an object 
- reread last lesson better
- eventlistener into each section listening for click and based on the player, put that character in the box
    - if box is taken, don't allow to update that cell
- check for three in a row in all directions somehow

- no idea how but create an AI somehow to play against
    - probably something with math.random selection output to random cell
