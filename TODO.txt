This spiraled, it does some stuff well but looking around shows just how off my thought process is especially
when it relates to factory functions. Will look at the house example from TOP and restructure some stuff.
I feel like I could do it with the way I'm going but it would take way longer and be way more complex and open to 
bugs so may do a fairly hard restart later.
